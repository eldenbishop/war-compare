# war-compare #

You are testing a Java web application, what version is it? What is different from the one running in QA? This single file JSP drop-in allows two running web applications to compare themselves dynamically at runtime. A visual tree browser lets you drill down to find the exact files that differ between two running instances. No file data is sent, only paths and MD5 hashes.

## Requirements ##

This tool only works with applications that support JSP files.

## Installation ##

Just drop md5.jsp into the root directory of your web application.

## Security (optional) ##

TODO

## Future ##

Add servlet support.
